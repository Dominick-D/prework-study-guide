        <ul>
          <li>A "card" in web design refers to a container element that groups related content together, such as a product listing or a social media post. It is typically styled with a border, box-shadow, and padding to create a distinctive look.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The "width" property sets the width of an element, either in pixels, ems, or as a percentage of its parent element's width.</li>
          <li>Width can also be set to "auto", which makes the element take up as much space as needed to fit its content without overflowing.</li>
          <li>The "box-shadow" property adds a shadow effect to an element, creating the illusion of depth and separation from the background.</li>
          <li>The "color" property sets the color of text inside an element, while the "background-color" property sets the color of the background behind the element.</li>
          <li>Colors can be specified in a variety of ways, including named colors (such as "red" or "blue"), hex codes (such as "#000000" or "#FFFFFF"), or RGB/RGBA values (such as "rgb(255, 0, 0)" or "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)").</li>
